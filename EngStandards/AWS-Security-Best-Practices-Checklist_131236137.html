                    <p>There are many actions to be taken to ensure your AWS environment is secure. Get started with this Top 10 checklist:</p><h2 id="AWSSecurityBestPracticesChecklist-Leveragemulti-factorauthentication">Leverage multi-factor authentication</h2><p>Using a standard username and password combo as the sole gatekeeper between your data and hackers is no longer the safest bet. Securing access to your cloud applications with multi-factor authentication adds an additional safeguard against wrongful access. MFA requires users to take an extra step like receiving an access code on their phone or onetime passwords to complete the login process so that even if a hacker obtains login credentials, they aren’t able to log in.</p><h2 id="AWSSecurityBestPracticesChecklist-Utilizeidentityandaccessmanagement">Utilize identity and access management</h2><p>Users expect to access your applications fast and with as few roadblocks as possible. As an organization, you must find the balance between streamlined access and secure data. Identity and access management (IAM) combines the three elements you need to achieve this: identification, authentication, and authorization.</p><h2 id="AWSSecurityBestPracticesChecklist-Maintainstrongvisibilityintoyourcloudenvironment">Maintain strong visibility into your cloud environment</h2><p>Blind spots are the enemy to any security posture. Having deep visibility into your cloud environment at all times is essential to maintaining operations, pinpointing issues, and adhering to compliance standards.</p><h2 id="AWSSecurityBestPracticesChecklist-Implementend-to-endencryption">Implement end-to-end encryption</h2><p>Cloud security should be more proactive than reactive. Encrypting data end-to-end is a proactive move that ensures that even if the worst happens—your data gets into the wrong hands—it’ll still be secure and unreadable.</p><h2 id="AWSSecurityBestPracticesChecklist-Monitorfileintegrity">Monitor file integrity</h2><p>Establishing a known baseline and regularly monitoring file integrity helps alert you to unwanted or malicious changes to your files sooner. Falling under the earlier mention of the importance of visibility, file integrity monitoring is crucial in keeping track of activity happening within your cloud environment.</p><h2 id="AWSSecurityBestPracticesChecklist-ImplementSSLcertificates">Implement SSL certificates</h2><p>SSL certificates enable encrypted communications between a web server and browser. SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs), which are organizations that are trusted to verify both the identity and the legitimacy of the entities requesting the certificate.</p><h2 id="AWSSecurityBestPracticesChecklist-Hardenconfigurationmanagement">Harden configuration management</h2><p>Configuration management (CM) is an important piece of the DevOps concept of treating infrastructure as code. Since CM execute arbitrary code on infrastructure, you need to harden the systems to protect sensitive data. You can leverage tools such as chef-vault to encrypt sensitive data using public keys or implement file integrity monitoring, as suggested above.</p><h2 id="AWSSecurityBestPracticesChecklist-Ensuresafeaccesstoproduction">Ensure safe access to production</h2><p>If you’re practicing continuous delivery, you likely give developers access to production for efficiency purposes. Securing and monitoring activity across production servers is critical. You should be monitoring for events that could be suspicious, such as package installations and updates, to ensure that your CM system is the only entity managing your hosts.</p><h2 id="AWSSecurityBestPracticesChecklist-Setupsecurityalerting">Set up security alerting</h2><p>You shouldn’t have to go looking for something anomalous. Setting up security alerting ensures that the second anomalous behavior is detecting, you’re aware of it. The key to useful security alerting is customization. By assigning different severity levels to different types of alerts, you can clear the clutter and hone in on anomalous, and possibly malicious activity.</p><h2 id="AWSSecurityBestPracticesChecklist-Educateemployees">Educate employees</h2><p>Implementing security protocols is only useful when your employees understand how and why to use them. Employees should know the security risks associated with the business they do. When you execute a new security practice such as multi-factor authentication, you should educate your employees on why it’s so important and how to use it.</p>
