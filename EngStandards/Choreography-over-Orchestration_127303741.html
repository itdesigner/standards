                    <p><span><span>Not only must service delivery, data modeling, and governance be decentralized, but also service integration. Enterprise integration of services has traditionally been accomplished via the enterprise service bus (ESB). The ESB becomes the owner of all routing, transformation, policy, security, and other decisions governing the interaction between services. We call this orchestration, analogous to the conductor who determines the course of the music performed by an orchestra during its performance. ESBs and orchestration make for very simple and pleasing architecture diagrams, but their simplicity is deceiving. Often hiding within the ESB is a tangled web of complexity. Managing this complexity becomes a full-time occupation, and working with it becomes a continual bottleneck for the application development team. Just as we saw with a federated data model, a federated integration solution like the ESB becomes a monolithic hazard to speed.</span></span><span> </span></p><p><span><span>Cloud-native architectures, such as microservices, tend to prefer choreography, akin to dancers in a ballet. Rather than placing the smarts in the integration mechanism, they are placed in the endpoints, akin to the dumb pipes and smart filters of the<span> </span></span></span><span><span>Unix</span></span><span><span><span> </span>architecture. When circumstances on stage differ from the original plan, there’s no conductor present to tell the dancers what to do. Instead, they simply adapt. In the same way, services adapt to changing circumstances in their environment via patterns such as client-side load balancing</span></span><span><span><span> </span>and circuit breakers.</span></span><span> </span></p><p><span><span>While the architecture diagrams tend to look like a tangled web, their complexity is no greater than a traditional SOA. Choreography simply acknowledges and exposes the essential complexity of the system. Once again this shift is in support of the autonomy required to enable the speed sought from cloud-native architectures. Teams are able to adapt to their changing circumstances without the difficult overhead of coordinating with other teams, and avoid the overhead of coordinating changes with a centrally-managed ESB.</span></span><span> </span></p><p><span>For more on this topic, see <a href="Orchestration-and-Choreography_131104996.html" data-linked-resource-id="131104996" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Orchestration and Choreography</a></span></p>
