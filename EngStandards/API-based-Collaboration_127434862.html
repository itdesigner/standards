The primary interaction model for the self-service infrastructure platform is also an API, just as it is with the business services.

Service consumers are not allowed to gain access to private implementation details of their dependencies or directly access their dependencies’ data stores. In fact, only one service is ever allowed to gain direct access to any data store. This forced decoupling directly supports the cloud-native goal of speed.  This also has the side benefit of promoting a System<span> </span></span></span><span><span>of</span></span><span><span><span> </span>Record (SOR) approach for the entire platform and each service.</span></span><span> </span></p>
