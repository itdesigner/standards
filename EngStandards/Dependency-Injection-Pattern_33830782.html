<p><span style="color: rgb(89,91,102);">Dependency injection is a software design pattern in which one or more dependencies (or services) are injected, or passed by reference, into a dependent object.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(89,91,102);">Think of it as<span style="color: rgb(36,39,41);"> a coding style that has its roots in the observation that object delegation is usually a more useful design pattern than object inheritance (i.e., the object has-a relationship is more useful than the object is-a relationship). One other ingredient is necessary however for DI to work, that of creating object interfaces. Combining these two powerful design patterns software engineers quickly realized that they could create flexible loosely coupled code and thus the concept of Dependency Injection was born. However it wasn't until object reflection became available in certain high level languages that DI really took off. The reflection component is core to most of today's DI systems today because the really cool aspects of DI require the ability to programmatically select objects and configure and inject them into other objects using a system external and independent to the objects themselves</span></span></p>

<p style="">&quot;Any nontrivial application is made up of two or more classes that collaborate with each other to perform some business logic. Traditionally, each object is responsible for obtaining its own references to the objects it collaborates with (its dependencies). When applying DI, the objects are given their dependencies at creation time by some external entity that coordinates each object in the system. In other words, dependencies are injected into objects.&quot;</p><p>I find that very clear.</p><p>Dependency Injection was originally called Inversion of Control (IoC) because the normal control sequence would be the object finds the objects it depends on by itself and then calls them. Here, this is reversed: The dependencies are handed to the object when it's created. This also illustrates the Hollywood Principle at work: Don't call around for your dependencies, we'll give them to you when we need you.</p><p><br/></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">If you don't use DI, you're probably wondering why it's a big deal. It delivers a key advantage: loose coupling. Objects can be added and tested independently of other objects, because they don't depend on anything other than what you pass them. When using traditional dependencies, to test an object you have to create an environment where all of its dependencies exist and are reachable before you can test it. With DI, it's possible to test the object in isolation passing it mock objects for the ones you don't want or need to create. Likewise, adding a class to a project is facilitated because the class is self-contained, so this avoids the &quot;big hairball&quot; that large projects often evolve into.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(89,91,102);">In this example, we are going to create a </span><code>UserModel</code><span style="color: rgb(89,91,102);">which gets a database dependency.</span></p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

  var db;

  if (!options.db) {
    throw new Error(&#39;Options.db is required&#39;);
  }

  db = options.db;

  return {
    create: function (done) {
      db.query(&#39;INSERT ...&#39;, done);
    }
  }
}

module.exports = userModel; </pre>

  db: db

</div></div><p class="auto-cursor-target"><span style="color: rgb(89,91,102);">Why is it helpful? It makes testing a lot easier - when you write your unit tests, you can easily inject a fake </span><code>db</code><span style="color: rgb(89,91,102);"> instance into the model.</span></p>
</div></div><div class="panel" style="background-color: white;border-color: black;border-style: solid;border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-color: black;background-color: black;color: white;"><b>Code Sample</b></div><div class="panelContent" style="background-color: white;">
<p style="">To help make all of this more concrete I'll use a running example (<strong>a very naive example</strong>) to talk about all of this. Like all of my examples it's one of those super-simple examples; small enough to be unreal, but hopefully enough for you to visualize what's going on without falling into the bog of a real example.</p><p style="">In this example I'm writing a component that provides a list of movies directed by a particular director. This stunningly useful function is implemented by a single method.</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeHeader panelHeader pdl" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><b>Sample JS Code</b></div><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="syntaxhighlighter-pre" data-syntaxhighlighter-params="brush: js; gutter: true; theme: Eclipse" data-theme="Eclipse">class MovieLister...
  public Movie[] moviesDirectedBy(String arg) {
      List allMovies = finder.findAll();
      for (Iterator it = allMovies.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
          Movie movie = (Movie) it.next();
          if (!movie.getDirector().equals(arg)) it.remove();
      }
      return (Movie[]) allMovies.toArray(new Movie[allMovies.size()]);
  }</pre>
</div></div><p style=""><br/></p><p style="">The implementation of this function is naive in the extreme, it asks a finder object (which we'll get to in a moment) to return every film it knows about. Then it just hunts through this list to return those directed by a particular director. This particular piece of naivety I'm not going to fix, since it's just the scaffolding for the real point of this article.</p><p style="">The real point of this article is this finder object, or particularly how we connect the lister object with a particular finder object. The reason why this is interesting is that I want my wonderful<span> </span><code>moviesDirectedBy</code><span> </span>method to be completely independent of how all the movies are being stored. So all the method does is refer to a finder, and all that finder does is know how to respond to the<span> </span><code>findAll</code><span> </span>method. I can bring this out by defining an interface for the finder.</p><p style=""><br/></p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeHeader panelHeader pdl" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><b>Sample JS Code</b></div><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="syntaxhighlighter-pre" data-syntaxhighlighter-params="brush: js; gutter: true; theme: Eclipse" data-theme="Eclipse">public interface MovieFinder {
    List findAll();
}</pre>
</div></div><p style="">Now all of this is very well decoupled, but at some point I have to come up with a concrete class to actually come up with the movies. In this case I put the code for this in the constructor of my lister class.</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeHeader panelHeader pdl" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><b>Sample JS Code</b></div><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="syntaxhighlighter-pre" data-syntaxhighlighter-params="brush: js; gutter: true; theme: Eclipse" data-theme="Eclipse">class MovieLister...
  private MovieFinder finder;
  public MovieLister() {
    finder = new ColonDelimitedMovieFinder(&quot;movies1.txt&quot;);
  }</pre>
</div></div><p style="">The name of the implementation class comes from the fact that I'm getting my list from a colon delimited text file. I'll spare you the details, after all the point is just that there's some implementation.</p><p style="">Now if I'm using this class for just myself, this is all fine and dandy. But what happens when my friends are overwhelmed by a desire for this wonderful functionality and would like a copy of my program? If they also store their movie listings in a colon delimited text file called &quot;movies1.txt&quot; then everything is wonderful. If they have a different name for their movies file, then it's easy to put the name of the file in a properties file. But what if they have a completely different form of storing their movie listing: a SQL database, an XML file, a web service, or just another format of text file? In this case we need a different class to grab that data. Now because I've defined a<span> </span><code>MovieFinder</code><span> </span>interface, this won't alter my<span> </span><code>moviesDirectedBy</code><span> </span>method. But I still need to have some way to get an instance of the right finder implementation into place.</p><p style=""><br/></p>

<p>Advantages</p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>DI code is much easier to reuse as the 'depended' functionality is extrapolated into well defined interfaces, allowing separate objects whose configuration is handled by a suitable application platform to be plugged into other objects at will.</li><li>DI code is much easier to test. The functionality expressed by the object can be tested in a black box by building 'mock' objects implementing the interfaces expected by your application logic.</li><li>DI code is more flexible. It is innately loosely coupled code -- to an extreme. This allows the programmer to pick and choose how objects are connected based exclusively on their required interfaces on one end and their expressed interfaces on the other.</li><li>External (Xml) configuration of DI objects means that others can customize your code in unforeseen directions.</li><li>External configuration is also a separation of concern pattern in that all problems of object initialization and object interdependency management can be handled by the application server.</li><li>Note that external configuration is not required to use the DI pattern, for simple interconnections a small builder object is often adequate. There is a tradeoff in flexibility between the two. A builder object is not as flexible an option as an externally visible configuration file. The developer of the DI system must weigh the advantages of flexibility over convenience, taking care that small scale, fine grain control over object construction as expressed in a configuration file may increase confusion and maintenance costs down the line.</li></ol><p>Disadvantages:</p><ol><li>Can tend to be more cumbersome until you are used to the coding style</li></ol>
