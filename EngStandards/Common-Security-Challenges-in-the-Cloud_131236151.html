                    <p>Cloud security is at the top of every organization’s mind before, during, and after their migration to Amazon Web Services. The following are a handful of common cloud security challenges:</p><h2 style="margin-left: 30.0px;" id="CommonSecurityChallengesintheCloud-Overcomingalackofvisibility">Overcoming a lack of visibility</h2><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">You’re running more applications on the cloud than ever. You have more people accessing those applications every day. Files change on a per-second basis. Without a security strategy in place to keep track of this near-constant activity, it can be difficult to pick out what activity is malicious or suspicious.</p><h2 style="margin-left: 30.0px;" id="CommonSecurityChallengesintheCloud-Prioritizingasecuritystrategyaheadofcontrolsandtools">Prioritizing a security strategy ahead of controls and tools</h2><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">You must decide early on whether to implement a security strategy first or controls and tools. In most cases, having a strategy in place first will lead to smoother, more effective security from day one.</p><h2 style="margin-left: 30.0px;" id="CommonSecurityChallengesintheCloud-Improvingconfidenceinacloudprovidersecurity">Improving confidence in a cloud provider security</h2><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">Security on the cloud is becoming a discussion earlier in the cloud migration process. You have pertinent questions to ask AWS and your cloud security provider about compliance, accessing log data, dealing with incident response, and more.</p><h2 style="margin-left: 30.0px;" id="CommonSecurityChallengesintheCloud-Establishingwhoisaccountable">Establishing who is accountable</h2><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">In the event that a security incident does occur in your cloud environment, you want to know who is liable and what the appropriate actions are. AWS’ Shared Responsibility Model sheds light on this subject.</p><h2 style="margin-left: 30.0px;" id="CommonSecurityChallengesintheCloud-Understandingthelurebehindcloudsecurityattacks">Understanding the lure behind cloud security attacks</h2><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">When you operate in the cloud, you’re likely trusting a lot of sensitive data to your cloud provider. This makes it a great target for attacks. More often than not, security incidents occur because of credential threat, not sophisticated zero-day attack against cloud providers themselves.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><br/></p><p>When evaluating the security of a cloud solution, it is important to understand and distinguish between:</p><ul><li>“<em>Security <strong>of</strong> the cloud</em>” — Security measures that the cloud service provider (AWS) implements and operates</li><li>&quot;<em>Security <strong>in</strong> the cloud</em>&quot; — Security measures that the customer implements and operates, related to the security of customer content and applications that make use of AWS services.</li></ul><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" height="400" src="attachments/131236151/131301835.png?height=400" data-image-src="attachments/131236151/131301835.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="131301835" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Screen Shot 2017-10-28 at 6.56.43 PM.png" data-base-url="https://placester.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="131236151" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" data-media-id="eef97aea-f6a0-469c-9b75-0a01770e406e" data-media-type="file"></span></p><h3 id="CommonSecurityChallengesintheCloud-WhatPartDoesAWSPlay?">What Part Does AWS Play?</h3><p>AWS ensures the security of the AWS Global Infrastructure of 42 Availability Zones within 16 geographic Regions around the world, in addition to compute, storage, database, and networking capabilities. AWS is also responsible for the security configuration of their managed services including Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic MapReduce, and more.</p><h3 id="CommonSecurityChallengesintheCloud-WhatPartDoYouPlay?">What Part Do You Play?</h3><p>You retain control and ownership over your data and what security you choose to implement to protect your own data, platform, applications, systems and networks, no differently than you would for applications in an on-site data center. This control over security implementations allows you to decide what security measures are necessary for your industry and organization, specifically.</p>
