                    <p>To meet critical SLAs and maintain reliability, modern digital enterprises running applications in the cloud must measure the performance of their revenue generated essential services, distributed applications, and infrastructures. For developers, DevOps and TechOps engineers, it can be confusing to know when to use metrics or log monitoring to isolate code performance anomalies, proactively monitor and baseline their scaled out, dynamic and distributed applications.</p>
<p>Metrics describe numeric measurements in time. The metric format includes the measured metric name, the metric data value, the timestamp, the metric source, and an optional tag. Metrics convey small information bits, much lighter than logs. Logs, unlike metrics, contain textual information about an event that occurred. Logs are meant to convey detailed information about the application, user, or system activity. The primary purpose of logs is troubleshooting a specific issue after the fact, e.g., code error, exception, security issue, or other.</p>
<p>This checklist will help you select the right approach for your environment.</p>
